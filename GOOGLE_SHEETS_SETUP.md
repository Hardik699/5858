# Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automatic syncing between your PC/Laptop management system and Google Sheets.

## Overview

Once configured, your application will automatically:
- ✅ Sync all PC/Laptop configurations to Google Sheets
- ✅ Create separate sheets for each component category (Mouse, Keyboard, RAM, Storage, etc.)
- ✅ Update data in real-time when you save changes
- ✅ Provide a summary sheet with data counts
- ✅ Allow manual sync and direct access to your Google Sheet

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Console account
- Admin access to your deployment environment
- Basic understanding of environment variables

## Step 1: Create Google Service Account

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create a new project or select existing project

2. **Enable Google Sheets API**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

3. **Create Service Account**
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" → "Service Accounts"
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Enter name: `pc-laptop-sheets-sync`
   - Enter description: `Service account for PC/Laptop management system`
   - Click "Create and Continue"

4. **Download Credentials**
   - Click on your newly created service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" → "Create new key"
   - Select "JSON" format
   - Download the JSON file
   - **Keep this file secure and never commit it to version control**

## Step 2: Create Google Sheet

1. **Create New Sheet**
   - Go to https://sheets.google.com/
   - Create a new Google Sheet
   - Name it something like "PC Laptop Assets Management"

2. **Share with Service Account**
   - Copy the `client_email` from your downloaded JSON credentials
   - Click "Share" button in your Google Sheet
   - Paste the service account email
   - Set permission to "Editor"
   - Uncheck "Notify people"
   - Click "Send"

3. **Get Sheet ID**
   - Copy the Sheet ID from the URL
   - Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms/edit`
   - Sheet ID is: `1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms`

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your deployment platform:

### Required Variables:

```bash
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions:

#### **Netlify**
1. Go to your site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Site settings" → "Environment variables"
3. Add both variables
4. Redeploy your site

#### **Vercel**
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add both variables
4. Redeploy your project

#### **Railway**
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Variables" tab
3. Add both variables
4. Railway will auto-redeploy

#### **Heroku**
1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Config Vars"
3. Add both variables
4. Restart your dynos

#### **Docker/VPS**
Add to your `.env` file or docker-compose.yml:
```bash
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}'
```

## Step 4: Format Service Account Credentials

The `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` should be the entire JSON file content as a single line string:

### Example Format:
```json
{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-123","private_key_id":"abc123","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvgIBADANB...","client_email":"pc-laptop-sheets-sync@your-project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"123456789","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/pc-laptop-sheets-sync%40your-project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
```

**Important:** Make sure the JSON is properly escaped if your platform requires it.

## Step 5: Test Configuration

1. **Redeploy your application** after adding environment variables
2. **Navigate to Google Sheets Config page** in your app
3. **Click "Check Configuration"** to verify setup
4. **Click "Test Sync"** to sync your current data
5. **Check your Google Sheet** to confirm data appears

## Features After Setup

### Automatic Syncing
- Data syncs automatically when you save PC/Laptop configurations
- Updates happen within 2 seconds of saving changes
- No manual intervention required

### Manual Sync Options
- "Sync to Sheets" button on PC/Laptop Info page
- "Export All Data" with direct Sheet sync on System Info page
- Manual sync button on Google Sheets Config page

### Sheet Organization
Your Google Sheet will contain these tabs:
- **PC-Laptop Info**: Complete PC configurations with component details
- **All System Assets**: Master list of all hardware assets
- **Category Sheets**: Mouse, Keyboard, Motherboard, RAM, Storage, etc.
- **Summary**: Data counts and overview

### Direct Access
- "View Sheets" button opens your Google Sheet directly
- Real-time collaboration with your team
- Standard Google Sheets features (charts, filters, sharing, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Google Sheets is not configured" error**
   - Check that environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify the service account email has Editor access to your sheet
   - Ensure your deployment restarted after adding variables

2. **"Authentication failed" error**
   - Verify the JSON credentials format
   - Check that the project ID matches
   - Ensure the private key is properly formatted

3. **"Sheet not found" error**
   - Verify the Sheet ID is correct
   - Confirm the service account has access to the sheet
   - Check that the sheet wasn't deleted or moved

4. **"Permission denied" error**
   - Service account needs Editor permissions
   - Re-share the sheet with the service account email
   - Check that the service account is active

### Getting Help:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Configuration**: Use the "Check Configuration" button
3. **Test Step by Step**: Follow each setup step carefully
4. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure they're properly set in your deployment

## Security Notes

- ✅ Service account credentials are stored securely as environment variables
- ✅ No sensitive data is logged in the application
- ✅ Only authorized service accounts can access your sheets
- ✅ Data transmission uses HTTPS encryption
- ❌ Never commit service account JSON files to version control
- ❌ Don't share service account credentials in plain text
